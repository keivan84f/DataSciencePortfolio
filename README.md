### [Breast_Cancer_Keras_Classification](https://nbviewer.org/github/keivan84f/Breast_Cancer_Keras_Classification/blob/84b9e2e63b0599709e1c1579cab44a8419038977/Breast_Cancer_Keras_Classification.ipynb)
#### (Training Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) algorithm on a dataset to build predictive model for breast cancer diagnosis)


Implemented reliability improvement initiatives for machine shop equipment, resulting in a 20% reduction in equipment failures and downtime. Collected and analyzed failure data from equipment sensors and maintenance records to identify failure patterns and develop predictive maintenance models. Conducted statistical analysis and reliability modeling to assess equipment performance, predict failure probabilities, and optimize maintenance schedules.
